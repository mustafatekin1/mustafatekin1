 Annotations:
 - @Test, @Before, @After, @AfterClass, @BeforeClass, @Ignore
 @Test : used to create and run test cases(the test methods with @Test annotations). This is like our main method in testing
 @Before:  is used for repetitive pre conditions, is executed before each test case
 @After : is used for repetitive post conditions, is executed after each test case
 @BeforeClass: is used for repetitive pre conditions for the class
 @AfterClass:
 Ignore: is used to skip the test cases (the test methods with @Test annotations)

 There are more annotations in TestNG
